# hello-world
Just my first repository following the guide


I am an aspiring coder. I have little offical coding experiance. 
It's limited to some formal highschool and college level classes as well as some fooling with scripts to make my life easier. 
I would love to do more because I feel like software development would be a good fit for me.
